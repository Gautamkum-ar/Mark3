      <p>September, 2022</p>
      Kashi Vishwanath Ki Nagri, as Varanasi is commonly called is a place that
      was ruled by Mughals and Kings in the past. This land of diverse Culture &
      Heritage, Rituals and beliefs, is one of the continuously inhabited cities
      of the world. A city that has a beautiful amalgamation of our religious
      past and a modern future which is also a hub for many saints and sages in
      the present has got the stature of being the Oldest City of India. The
      city has the finest river frontage in India with miles of Ghats or steps
      for religious bathing, an array of shrines and temples and various other
      beautiful palaces. Being the center of Hindu learning, Kashi – (another
      name of Varanasi) is also a city of learned scholars that run countless
      such schools for the continuation of traditional learning. People visiting
      temples People visiting temples “Yahaan Madhav Ki Chaaya Hai Aur Moksha Ki
      Maaya Hai”. Talking about this religious capital of the country, today
      through our blog, we will take a stroll to its famous temples and the
      presiding deities of these temples. Apart from learning about the
      importance of these temples, we will also take a step in the history to
      know about the historic significance of these temples. Our list of temples
      include the following: Kashi Vishwanath Temple Durga Temple Tulsi Manas
      Temple Tridev Temple Birla Temple Nepalese Temple Chinese Temple Sankat
      Mochan Mandir Vishalakshmi Temple Kalbhairava Mandir
      <h2>1. Kashi Vishwanath Temple</h2>
      This is one of the holiest Shiva Temple of the city. As the name suggests
      it is a temple on the name of Supreme Lord of Universe – Lord Shiva who is
      the presiding deity of this temple. Thus Kashi is also known as the city
      of Lord Shiva. The temple houses a “Shivalinga” – (an abstract or an
      iconic representation of the Hindu deity Shiva in Shaivism) which is said
      to be amongst one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Shiva. These are said to be
      the fiery pillars of light by which Lord Shiva beckoned his divine
      supremacy over all other Gods, broke through earth’s crust and gleam
      towards heaven. It is believed that Varanasi is a place where the first
      Jyotirlinga manifested itself. Kashi is believed to be at the center of
      the Hindu doctrine of cosmogony. If Kashi is at the heart of Hinduism,
      then Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the heartbeat of this godly land. But this
      temple has undergone various tests of time when it was marred by many
      atrocious events of history. The temple has been demolished several times
      by kings and rulers of the country time and again. First by Qutb-ud-din
      Aibak, then during the reign of Illtutmish, followed by Sikandar Lodhi and
      lastly, it was demolished by Emperor Aurangzeb’s crusader activities to
      propagate Islam. But it is remarkable to see how the temple still stands
      tall in all its majesty and glory. The temple is also called the Golden
      Temple of Varanasi as Maharaja Ranjit Singh donated about 1000 kg gold
      here of which the dome of the temple is built. Being an important city of
      Hindus, a city of Lord Shiva, the temple is believed to possess powers of
      salvation – a Mukti from the cycle of birth and death. People have a
      staunch belief that here Lord Shiva gives the ultimate Tarak Mantra to the
      ones who are in their last few days of life due to which they achieve a
      stage of salvation. People also have a belief that if you pray to Kashi
      Vishwanath regularly, all your desires are fulfilled. Therefore, situated
      amidst the narrow lanes of the city, the serene temple is mostly jammed
      with swarms of people who have come here for darshan of their Supreme
      Lord.
      <h2>2. Durga Temple</h2>
      Goddess Durga is considered as the idol of strength in Hindu mythology.
      Dedicated to her is a temple constructed by a Bengali Maharani – The queen
      of Bengal, who was a staunch believer of the Goddess. As per the excerpts
      of history, the temple has a very interesting and mythological story
      related to it. Ancient temple of kashi Ancient temple of Kashi Once the
      Kashi Naresh – the King of Kashi called for a Swayamvar – (where a person
      gets a right to choose a partner for life) for his only daughter
      Shashikala’s marriage but he came to know that the princess was in love
      with Prince Sudarshan. So he secretly got his daughter married to
      Sudarshan. When all other suitors who came for Swayamvar to get to know
      about their marriage, they rage a war against the King and Sudarshan.
      Being a staunch believer of Maa Durga, Sudarshan calls for prayers to the
      deity who is then believed to come on lion and fought a war for them both.
      Then Kashi Naresh pleaded Maa Durga to protect the city of Kashi always
      and eradicate the evil. So it is believed that the idol of the deity
      inside the temple was not constructed by any human rather it appeared on
      its own. Then in the 18th C, the temple was built in North Indian Nagara
      style of architecture and the entire temple was painted red to match the
      color of the idol of Maa Durga inside which is seen majestically sitting
      on a lion armed with a trident, sword and a discus in the hands. This
      temple represents a staunch belief system that if you trust God, He will
      always come to your rescue.
      <h2>3. Tulsi Manas Temple</h2>
      Dedicated to Lord Rama, Tulsi Manas is one of the most famous temples of
      Varanasi. The temple is situated amidst a beautiful garden and is made up
      of white marble. this temple has a great historical importance as this is
      the place where the great epic of Ramcharitmanas – the lakes of deeds of
      Lord Rama, was written by a revered Hindu poet-saint Tulsidas Ji in 16th C
      in Hindi language. Constructed by the Sureka family of Bandhaghat, Howrah,
      West Bengal the temple’s walls depict various verses and scenes from the
      epic and are primarily dedicated to Lord Rama, Mata Sita, Lakshaman and
      Lord Hanuman. the temple was inaugurated by HH Dr. Sarvapalli
      Radhakrishnan.
      <h2>4. Tridev Temple</h2>
      This is another holy temple in the pious city of Varanasi which is nearby
      to Tulsi Manas Temple. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to
      three lords – “tri” means “three” and “dev” means “Gods”. They are Salasar
      Lord Hanuman, Dadi Rani Devi Sati, and Khatu Ji Maharaj. It is believed
      that the spiritual atmosphere of the temple helps them to form a divine
      connection with God. This is one of the reasons that people visit here
      from far off places to attain a spiritual calm and strength from Almighty.
      Being one of the famous temples of the city, people make sure to visit
      here during their trips to Kashi or Varanasi.
      <h2>5. Birla Temple</h2>
      As the city of Varanasi is said to be called the city of Vishwanath – Lord
      Shiva, there is another famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple here. Since the
      temple was founded by the Raja Birla of the Birla family of great
      industrialists in the vicinity of Banaras Hindu University, it is given
      the name of Birla temple. Planned by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya (the founder
      of the Banaras Hindu University) as part of the BHU campus is a circle of
      nine temples dedicated to different deities. The Temple is open to all the
      people irrespective of many castes and religions. Being dedicated to Lord
      Shiva, this temple is an exact copy of the original Vishwanath Temple. The
      center of the temple has a Shiva lingam – the idol of Lord Shiva and the
      walls of the temple have inscriptions of the Hindu scriptures. Being a
      matchless and ostentatious temple in the entire Varanasi, the tower of the
      temple is known as the tallest temple tower which is taller than the Qutub
      Minar. A large swarm of devotees from across the globe visit here to pay
      homage to the deity. Loud sounds of “Har Har Mahadev” – (Hail the deity)
      and Jai Bholenath echoes in the air. Monday is a special day when devotees
      perform worship of Lord Shiva in order to fulfill their wishes. Every
      Monday Rudrabhishek is performed in the vicinity of the temple.
      <h2>6. Nepalese Temple</h2>
      Close to river Ganga, Nepali temple is a small but beautiful temple
      situated at Lalita Ghat. As the name suggests temple was constructed by
      the king of Nepal Rana Bhadur Shah during his exile period from 1800 AD to
      1804 AD due to his decision of staying in the city and making a replica of
      Pashupatinath Temple in Varanasi. Although the construction work of the
      temple started during his period of stay in Varanasi but then Shah moved
      back to Nepal while the construction of the temple was still going on.
      Later on, Rana Bahadur Shah died and the project got completed by his son
      Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah Deva 20 years after the planned deadline. After
      that, the land was transferred to Rana Bahadur Shah by the king of Nepal
      in 1843. The temple is also called mini Khajuraho because the sculptures
      of the temple are similar to the ones displayed in the Khajuraho group of
      monuments. Made up of terracotta, stone, and wood, ethically temple took
      around three decades to reach its final shape. The architecture of the
      temple was made ina Pagoda style – (five-storey Pagoda), where the entire
      wood is termite-free. So during your next visit to the city of temples,

      the ancient fire that is burning inside for ages. There is again an
      interesting story about the temple fire. It is believed that due to a boon
      by Lord Shiva, He said that whosoever’s pyre will be lighted first by this
      fire will attain a complete salvation thereby getting rid of the cycle of
      death and re-birth. This is the reason that during their old-age people

      deity – Bhairava Baba. According to a famous folklore, not only of the
      people, but Baba is believed to be the King of all the Gods. As the word
      Kal means both death and fate, it is believed that even death is afraid of
      Kaal Bhairava. Baba’s idol can be seen in silver color housed in the inner
      sanctum of the temple seated on his Vahana – (vehicle) a dog. In his
      fierce gesture, wearing a garland of skulls and holding a trident. The

      the peacock feathers in their hands which is believed to wade-off all the
      sins of the pilgrims and bless them. Sundays and Tuesdays are considered
      to be the important days to offer prayer to the deity. Therefore, taking a
